# Python script for fetching the "region" data from the Event Brite JSON API and 
# counting the number of occurences for events in each state of the United States.
# 
# I have focused on the data from United States only for greater representational purpose.
# Similar exercise and codes can be written for analysis of data throughout the globe

# Author: Ashwin Tumma <ashwin.tumma@stonybrook.edu>
# Date: March 18, 2015

# Central Idea: 
# -------------
# The address of each event is encoded in the JSON string for the event. It is readily accessible 
# through [events].[venue] value. There are fine grained and coarse grained address values available
# for the events. But for our purposes we will be working with the coarse grained address values, 
# which is the state in which the event has/ will occur. 
# The value for the State is encoded in [events][address][region] value, but before accessing that, 
# as mentioned in the above comments, we will be using regions only from the United States, so for this 
# reason, we filter the values based on country as well [events][address][country] = "US" (for United States)

# Usage: 
# ----------
# $ python GetStatesCounters.py > DataPoints.txt
# The output of this program is redirected to the DataPoints.txt file

# Alternatives for usage: 
# ------------------
# I chose to redirect the output of this program to a text file from commmand line, to avoid 
# increasing lines of code in this file. But having said that, alternatively, we can also write the 
# data to a file mentioned by the user at command line.
